# SQL_CAPSTONE_Market_Spendings

Analyze the marketing spending.
1.	Overall ROMI
2.	ROMI by campaigns
3.	Performance of the campaign depending on the date - on which date did we spend the most money on advertising, when we got the biggest revenue when conversion rates were high and low? What were the average order values?
4.	When buyers are more active? What is the average revenue on weekdays and weekends?
5.	Which types of campaigns work best - social, banner, influencer, or a search?
6.	Which geo locations are better for targeting - tier 1 or tier 2 cities?
